# Copy this file to .env and adjust values as needed

# Trading Parameters
# ------------------

# Price threshold for detecting opportunities (default: 0.70)
# When bid or last trade price exceeds this value, an opportunity is flagged
OPPORTUNITY_THRESHOLD=0.70

# Automatic Trading
# -----------------
# Enable automatic limit order execution when opportunities are detected

# Enable automatic trade execution (default: false)

# This is the maximum price per share for buy limit orders
# Lower values may result in unfilled orders, higher values increase cost
LIMIT_BUY_PRICE=0.90

# Multiplier applied to trade size on each market reversal (default: 1.5)
# When a market reverses direction (YES→NO or NO→YES), the trade size is multiplied
# by this value. Example: With REVERSAL_MULTIPLIER=2.0 and base 3 shares,
# after 2 reversals the trade size becomes 12 shares (3 × 2.0 × 2.0)
REVERSAL_MULTIPLIER=1.5

# Wallet private key for signing transactions (REQUIRED for trading)
# Your Polygon wallet private key (64 hex characters without 0x prefix)

# -----------------

# Minutes before window end to start monitoring (default: 3)
# Monitoring begins at minute 12, 27, 42, or 57 of each hour
MONITOR_START_MINUTES=3

# Series-Based Market Selection
# -----------------------------
# Comma-separated list of Polymarket series IDs to monitor
# A "series" is a higher-level abstraction that encapsulates all recurring
# instances of an event/market that are identical other than the time period.
#
# For each series, the monitor will:
# 1. Query the Gamma API for events in that series
# 2. Find the event whose time period covers the current time
# 3. Monitor the associated market for price opportunities
#
# You can discover series IDs by browsing Polymarket markets or through the API.
# Example: SERIES_IDS=abc123,def456,ghi789
# Find series IDs with the Polymarket API, e.g. curl 'https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?tag_id=102467&closed=false'
#   and examining the series[] element.
# As of 09 Jan 2026:

#   10192 = BTC up/down 15-min
