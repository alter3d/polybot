# instances of an event/market that are identical other than the time period.
#
# For each series, the monitor will:
# 1. Query the Gamma API for events in that series
# 2. Find the event whose time period covers the current time
# 3. Monitor the associated market for price opportunities
#
# You can discover series IDs by browsing Polymarket markets or through the API.
# Example: SERIES_IDS=abc123,def456,ghi789
